# gilbert
My sure to be failed attempt at a point and click adventure game (and/or) engine.

## Requirements:

* SDL2. (`brew install sdl2`)

## Building it:

* Run `make build`.  It is essentially equal to running `make setup && make compile`.

## Running it:

* Run `make run` or `build/gilbert`.  The make target is just a convenience thing I added so I could run code from within Sublime Text.
